1. DiverseClassifiers： Conduct supervised learning on diverse classifiers, including logistic regression as a baseline and various machine learning classifiers.

2. LogisticRegression: Logistic Regression with Multiple Variables.

3. LogisticRegressionRevisited： Revisit logistic regression in two paradigms:
* Benchmark logistic regression (Stat Paradigm)
* Logistic regression in Machine Learning (ML Paradigm)

4. MultivariateRegressions: Run and analyze multiple linear regression models using the statsmodels library.

5. NetworkAnalysis&GIS: Introduce the use of Python modules such as geopandas and networkx for network analysis and GIS tasks.

6. Practice: practice coding by using all the past scripts and make fairness evaluation.

7. Regularization: Introduce the concepts of overfitting and regularization in the context of linear regression using Python modules such as statsmodels and sklearn.

8. SpatialAutocorrelation&Regression: Focuse on spatial autocorrelation and regression, using modules such as pysal, geopandas, and statsmodels.\

9. Visualization&UnivariateRegressions: Provide a comprehensive introduction to visualization and univariate linear regressions using Matplotlib and statsmodels.api.

10. PythonRefresherScript: Basic operation in python.
