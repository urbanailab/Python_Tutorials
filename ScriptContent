1. DiverseClassifiers： Conduct supervised learning on diverse classifiers, including logistic regression as a baseline and various machine learning classifiers.

2. GoogleMapAPI: Demonstrate how to retrieve street view and satellite images using the Google Maps API in Python.

3. ImagePredictScript: Use satellite and street view images and ResNet-18 to predict mobility variables.

4. LogisticRegression: Logistic Regression with Multiple Variables.

5. LogisticRegressionRevisited： Revisit logistic regression in two paradigms:
* Benchmark logistic regression (Stat Paradigm)
* Logistic regression in Machine Learning (ML Paradigm)

6. main: Utilize nbconvert to convert a Jupyter Notebook into Python code and then executes the generated Python code in the current namespace. The purpose is to run Jupyter Notebook code as a part of a Python script.

7. MultivariateRegressions: Run and analyze multiple linear regression models using the statsmodels library.

8. NetworkAnalysis&GIS: Introduce the use of Python modules such as geopandas and networkx for network analysis and GIS tasks.

9. Practice: practice coding by using all the past scripts and make fairness evaluation.

10. Regularization: Introduce the concepts of overfitting and regularization in the context of linear regression using Python modules such as statsmodels and sklearn.

11. SpatialAutocorrelation&Regression: Focuse on spatial autocorrelation and regression, using modules such as pysal, geopandas, and statsmodels.\

12. Visualization&UnivariateRegressions: Provide a comprehensive introduction to visualization and univariate linear regressions using Matplotlib and statsmodels.api.

13. CustomDataset: Define a custom PyTorch dataset (CustomDataset) for image classification.

14. PythonRefresherScript: Basic operation in python.
